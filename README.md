# Indian Classical Dance Form Classification
India is a culturally rich country with hundreds of
dance forms that originated from various parts of the country.
Many of these dance forms have shared origins having common
postures, movements, and expressions. So, it becomes difficult for
the common eye to identify which is the form of dance performed.
To solve this problem, we have developed a classical dance
form classifier that identifies seven different Indian classical
dance forms. We have developed our model based on LSTM
architecture. We have also created a dataset of more than 700
dance clips downloaded from Youtube.
